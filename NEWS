Changes in Version 3.2.0 March 2020
o Update of the S3method predict.jointSurroPena(). We have included a plot of the predicted treatment effects on the true endpoint (with the prediction intervals) given the observed treatment effects on the surrogate endpoint and an object from the joint surrogate model.
